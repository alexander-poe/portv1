				Hey my name is Alex and I like to solve problems, make creative things, and ride bikes. I want to be challenged in a job and come home at the end of the day feeling like 'wow I can't believe we did it'. Well, maybe not every day but I would say half of the days is a good balance. I also really love writing music, which I think is very similar to writing code. Enjoy my site!

						<p class="project-descriptionbig">
							Challenge: The challenge was managing the state of the React app with multiple one to one and one to many relationships being served from the backend. Going into this project we wanted to use as little plugins and packages as possible to be challenged with writing the code from scratch. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="project-descriptionbig">
							Tech: My favorite part of this project was the process of finding the best solution to manage the state of different users in relation to their photos, comments, and replies. Using redux and carefully crafted reducers we managed the state of the application flawlessly. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="project-descriptionbig">
							Takeaways: Managing the state of the front end application and data structuring can have a wide variety of reasonable approaches. Taking the time to critically plan out the right approach suited for the clients is a valuable thing  to do and served us well in the creation of Family Page.

							Challenge: To boil down the essence of auto-suggestion logic into a new implementation that could be done within a day.
						</p>
					</li>
				 	 <li>
						<p class="project-description">
							Tech: The boiled down version of auto-suggestion which excluded levenshtein distance, approximate string and phonetic matching was to match based on characters and their position.  
						</p>
					</li>
				 	 <li>
						<p class="project-description">
							Takeaways: This project taught me how to abstract complex task and ideas into minimum viable product. It’d would be very interesting to re-write the logic using Python and see how performance is affected.

							<p class="project-descriptionbig">
					 			Challenge: The challenge of this project was to create a UX that would emulate the experience of learning with flashcards. This project was also the first project where I used Passport, Bearer and Oauth to authenticate a user's profile. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="project-descriptionbig">
								Tech: Having the CRUD API interact with the front-end while being authenticated posed some interesting yet predictable challenges. Using react-cookies to send authentication tokens in the header of our fetch calls allowed us to retrieve data securely and privately. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="project-descriptionbig">
								Takeaways: UX is at the helm of modern development, eCommerce and of critical importance to create products that work seamlessly with what the user wants. Modeling modern days apps to feel like real world things provides benefit in familiarity and usability.

							Overview: Discover recipes, see their ingredients and nutritional facts without needing to open new tabs. Vegan, GF, Vegetarian, Peanut allergies? You're in luck, we use filters to provide suggestions for your needs. This project was created while pair programming, allowing both of us to talk about different approaches to arrive upon best solution.

				<li>
					<p class="project-description">
						Challenge: Going into this project we wanted to create a UX that provided a lot of value in content with minimal clicks. I had experienced that searching for recipes lead to an over clustered browser full of tabs, we wanted to solve this problem with a one stop shop for finding great recipes.   
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="project-description">
						Tech: For this project we used Edamames API and jQuery for presentation and AJAX. JQuery provided a very easy to use framework for writing essential front end operations like conditional component like rendering, handling events and API calls.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="project-description">
						Takeaways: JQuery can be a powerful solution for simple data display applications and can appropriate for projects of this scope. I find jQuery very easy to work with yet I have also seen jQuery codebases start to look like a bowl of code spaghetti. This is where component based frameworks like Ember.js and React.js shine because they separate concerns architecturally making the app easier to manage as it scales.

							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="project-descriptionbig">
									Challenge: Color Helper sought out to solve the challenge of picking color schemes by providing a quicker way to see colors in action.  
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="project-descriptionbig">
									Tech: This app uses Styled-Components, a package for writing CSS in React components. Color Helper utilizes a single controller component which allows the manipulation of color properties across different components through the usage of props. 
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="project-descriptionbig">
									Takeaways: Creating a tool for other developers should be simple, easy to use and provide apparent value from the start. Color Helper allowed me to constantly come back to the question of how can this be better. I would like to expand this project by creating multiple mockups which a user could toggle between to get a more realistic view of how color schemes might look.

						</p>
					</li>
				  <li>
						<p class="project-description">
							Tech: React-Native was the tool of choice to make this a dedicated mobile application without having to dive into Java and Objective-C.  I enjoyed the familiarity to React but I didn’t like the way components are styled in React-Native. 
						</p>
					</li>
				  <li>
						<p class="project-description">	
							Takeaways: React-Native provides a powerful solution for writing mobile apps and could be useful when starting a green project considering there are many React developers out there who could easily understand the basic idea of React-Native from experience with React.
