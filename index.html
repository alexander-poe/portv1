				Hi my name is Alex, I am a Web developer, with a background in entrepreneurship. I have always loved creating things and seeing projects come to life. I spend most of my time reading coding blogs, taking udemy courses, attending meetups and creating projects. When I am not doing that I like to get the blood pumping with some form of exercise.

							Overview: this photo sharing app was made with two colleagues and myself for our graduation project. I took responsibility entirely for the design and ensuring its mobile responsiveness as well as various parts of the front end.

					<li>
						<p class="project-descriptionbig">
							Challenge: the challenge of Family Page was to create a platform where families can share their photos, as well as directly respond to the poster of a photo without the whole group seeing. Furthermore, we went into this project with the plan to avoid plugins and bootstrapped styles and instead write everything from scratch.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="project-descriptionbig">
							Tech: My favorite part of this project was working with Airbnb's style guide and the use of prop types. The features I contributed to was, filters, dynamic classes, date separation and navigation on the gallery page. We frequently worked in pairs as to have a more holistic understanding of the entirety of Family Page.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="project-descriptionbig">
							Takeaways: I found that working with Airbnb's style guide was tremendously informative and helpful in working with two other teammates. In hindsight, I would have liked to spend more time optimizing the site, with lazy loading, and image size constraints to reduce loading more than is being seen.

						<p class="project-description">
						Overview: Fuzzy finder is exactly that! It is auto suggestion so you can find what you are looking for even when you don't know exactly what the title is. This was a solo project and a great learning experience into the world of fuzzy finders, which has large degrees of varying complexity.

							Challenge: This app posed the challenge of how far down the rabbit hole I wanted to go. From approximate string matching, to auto suggestions based on phonetics the rabbit hole got deep quickly.
						</p>
					</li>
				 	 <li>
						<p class="project-description">
							Tech: I ended up using an algorithm that matches the characters of the text with the query in relation to order of the characters and character position. Not to mention, the dataset the algorithim is using is over 1500 entries and the runtime of this problem could sky rocket quickly. 
						</p>
					</li>
				 	 <li>
						<p class="project-description">
							Takeaways: In this project I learned a lot about how to work with more bigger data and how to create a system that could handle such. The performance was clearly noticeable with different solutions.

							<p class="project-descriptionbig">
					 			Challenge: The challenge of this project was to create a simple UI that would represent a flashcard-like approach to learning. We ran into a challenge with authentication that I was able to debug by installing react-cookies and sending cookies in the header of the action. I will further elaborate on the next slide.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="project-descriptionbig">
								Tech: Essentially with passport's google authentication a user signs in with their google information and an authentication token is stored in the cookies. Bearer, used for route authentication requires the authentication token in cookies for access. When the cookie was not included in the request to the server, Bearer did its job and denied access.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="project-descriptionbig">
								Takeaways: This project was a fun with a lower level of complexity and moving parts compared to the projects I am working on now. I'd like to explore making this entire project dynamic in a way that a user could customize the theme of the project and the questions that are asked. It could be an all around much more useful tool with those capabilities.

					<p class="project-description">
						Challenge: Going into this project we wanted to create a enticing UX that involved
						lots of recipies and zero being sent down a wormhole of sites to find the right meal. Both me
						and my partner had experienced this as a problem and set out to fix it with recipe search.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="project-description">
						Tech: For this project we used Edamames API which had a plethora of possibilites and jQuery to manipulate
						the DOM. There is a lot of possiblities and directions to go with this app, but before proceeding I would like
						to switch over from JQuery to React allowing the app to scale in a cleaner manner.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="project-description">
						Takeaways: This is a very useful app in ways and also has the potential to be much more.
						It would be fantasic to use other recipe API's and integrate it into the current system to have a
						wider base of choices.

							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="project-descriptionbig">
									Challenge: The challenge of this project to make an easier way to choose the color scheme of your app without the use of dev tools or frequent reloads.
									Futhermore, to do this in way that is dynamic enough that you could reuse the same components for views in different screen sizes.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="project-descriptionbig">
									Tech: This app uses styled-components which is a react package for writing inline styles without creating seperate style objects. Basically,
									each component displayed in the Iphone mockup will change based on the result of the control input. This way you can not only easily try out multiple colors
									but can take the #hex codes immediately and use them in your app.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="project-descriptionbig">
									Takeaways: Where to start, I have quite a few idea with this technology. In the same way that I altered the colors, I could alter any property of the css.
									Now I would have to do this in a way that would maintain scalability of course. I'd like to have multiple color control options, for phones, tablets and desktops to
									accomodate whatever the user needs.

						</p>
					</li>
				  <li>
						<p class="project-description">
							Tech: Using react-native made this an exciting project and I learned a lot along the way. The way elements
							are turned into widgets / components is an interesting choice as well as inline styling. I have not experience workig with true native
							code so I cannot really compare but I do like the familiarity to react. Moving forward I'd like to use native-base for
							the UI, to have a consistent look with other popular mobile apps.
						</p>
					</li>
				  <li>
						<p class="project-description">
							Overview: This has been v1 of my finance app and with the most recent create-react-native-app released

							a one week journey to learn a new language. More coming...
